    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>Jockey's Convention Center was built in 1960 and completed in 1974 for the opening ceremony of the
      23rd annual conference of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) held in early April 1974.
      The conference was a major event for Jakarta and several major hotel projects, such as the
      expansion of Hotel Indonesia, Borobudur Hotel, Hotel Ambassador (now Aryaduta Hotel), and
      Hotel Sahid Jaya, are also targeted to be completed before the PATA conference begins.
      Since then, Jockey's Convention Center has held many national and international conference, exhibition,
      fair, indoor sports, and musical concerts.</p>
